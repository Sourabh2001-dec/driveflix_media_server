# DriveFlix Media Server
- A Node JS backend application to stream video files from google drive using google drive apis.
- It also supports html video requests for partial file contents to prevent whole file from being buffered and streamed.
- The server is part of my project [Driveflix](https://driveflix.netlify.app/)
